    "# Adversarial Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how to use Gurobi Machine Learning to construct an adversarial example for a trained neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the MNIST handwritten digit database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we are given a trained neural network and one well classified example $\\bar x$.\n",
    "Our goal is to construct another example $x$ _close to_ $\\bar x$ that is classified with another label.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the hand digit recognition problem, the input is a grayscale image of $28 \\times 28$ ($=784$) pixels and the output is a vector of length 10 (each entry corresponding to a digit). We denote the output vector by $y$. The image is classified according to the largest entry of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training example, assume that coordinate $l$ of the output vector was the one with the largest value giving the correct label. We pick a coordinate corresponding to another label, denoted $w$, and we want the difference between $y_w - y_l$ to be as large as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can find a solution where this difference is positive, then $x$ is a counter-example that will receive a different label. If instead we can show that the difference is non-positive, no such counter-example exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define the neighborhood using the $l1-$norm $|| x - \\bar x ||_1$. The size of the neighborhood is defined by a fixed parameter $\\delta$. We want\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|| x - \\bar x ||_1 \\le \\delta.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "&\\max y_w - y_l \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{subject to:}\\\\\n",

    "& y = g(x).\n",

    "## Imports and loading data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the required packages for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the usual packages, we will need `matplotlib` to plot the digits, `joblib` to load a pre-trained network and `pandas` that is the format in which training examples are stored.\n",
