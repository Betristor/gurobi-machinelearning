Welcome to Gurobi Machine Learning!
===================================

Gurobi Machine Learning is a Python package to help use *trained* regression models in
mathematical optimization models. The package supports a variety of regression models
(linear, logistic, neural networks, decision trees,...) trained by
different machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, Keras and PyTorch). They are inserted in a
`gurobipy model <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/py_model.html>`_
to be solved with the `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com>`_ solver.
