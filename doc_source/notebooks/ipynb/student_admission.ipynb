    "<cite data-cite=\"JANOS\">Bergman et.al. (2020)</cite> with Gurobi Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model was developed in the context of the development of\n",
    "[Janos](https://github.com/INFORMSJoC/2020.1023), a toolkit similar to\n",
    "Gurobi Machine Learning to integrate ML models and Mathematical optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we illustrate in particular how to use the logistic regression and changing parameters\n",
    "to tune the piece wise linear approximation of the logistic function.\n",
    "We also show how to deal with fixed features in the optimization model using pandas data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, data of students admissions in a college is used to predict the probability\n",
    "that a student enrolls to the college.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has 3 features:\n",
    "the SAT and GPA scores of each student,\n",
    "and the scholarship (or merit) that was offered to each student.\n",
    "Finally, it is known if each student decided to join or not the college.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this data a logistic regression is trained to predict the probability that\n",
    "a student joins the college.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this regression model,\n",
    "<cite data-cite=\"JANOS\">Bergman et.al. (2020)</cite>\n",
    "proposes the following student enrollment\n",
    "problem. The Admission Office has data for SAT and GPA scores of the admitted students for\n",
    "the incoming class, and they would want to offer scholarships to students with the goal of\n",
    "maximizing the expected number of students that enroll in the college. There is a total\n",
    "of $n$ student that are admitted. The maximal\n",
    "budget for the sum of all scholarships offered is $0.2 n \\, \\text{K\\$}$ and each student can be offered a\n",
    "scholarship of at most $2.5 \\, K\\$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be expressed as a mathematical optimization problem as follows.\n",
    "Two vectors of decision variables $x$ and $y$ of dimension $n$ are used to model\n",
    "respectively the scholarship offered to each student in $K\\$$ and the probability\n",
    "that they join.\n",
    "Denoting by $g$ the prediction function for the probability of the logistic regression we then have for each student $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = g(x_i, SAT_i, GPA_i),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $SAT_i$ and $GPA_i$ the (known) SAT and GPA score of each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to maximize the sum of the $y$ variables and the budget constraint imposes\n",
    "that the sum of the variables $x$ is less or equal to $0.2n$. Also, each variable $x_i$ is between 0 and 2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full model then reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&\\max \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{subject to:}\\\\\n",
    "&\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\le 0.2*n,\\\\\n",
    "&y_i = g(x_i, SAT_i, GPA_i) & & i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\\\\n",
    "& 0 \\le x \\le 2.5.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this example differently to\n",
    "<cite data-cite=\"JANOS\">Bergman et.al. (2020)</cite>\n",
    "in that we scale the features for the regression.\n",
    "Also, to fit in Gurobi's limited size license we only consider the problem where $n=250$.\n",
