    "# Adversarial Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how to use Gurobi Machine Learning to construct an\n",
    "adversarial example for a trained neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the MNIST handwritten digit database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)\n",
    "for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we are given a trained neural network and one well classified\n",
    "example $\\bar x$. Our goal is to construct another example $x$ _close to_ $\\bar\n",
    "x$ that is classified with another label.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the hand digit recognition problem, the input is a grayscale image of $28\n",
    "\\times 28$ ($=784$) pixels and the output is a vector of length 10 (each entry\n",
    "corresponding to a digit). We denote the output vector by $y$. The image is\n",
    "classified according to the largest entry of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training example, assume that coordinate $l$ of the output vector was\n",
    "the one with the largest value giving the correct label. We pick a coordinate\n",
    "corresponding to another label, denoted $w$, and we want the difference between\n",
    "$y_w - y_l$ to be as large as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can find a solution where this difference is positive, then $x$ is a\n",
    "counter-example that will receive a different label. If instead we can show that\n",
    "the difference is non-positive, no such counter-example exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define the neighborhood using the $l1-$norm $|| x - \\bar x\n",
    "||_1$. The size of the neighborhood is defined by a fixed parameter $\\delta$. We\n",
    "want\n",

    "&\\text{subject to:}\\\\\n",
    "&|| x - \\bar x ||_1 \\le \\delta,\\\\\n",
    "& y = g(x). \\end{aligned} $$\n",
