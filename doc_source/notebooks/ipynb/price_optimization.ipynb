Avocado Pricing and Supply Using Mathematical Optimization](https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/tree/master/price_optimization). It is only aimed at showing the capabilities of Gurobi Machine Learning. Please visit the full notebook page, for detailed explanations and analysis of the problem.\n",

Avocados are expensive.\n",
